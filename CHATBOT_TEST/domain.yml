  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The
      spreading from person-to-person. Itâ€™s important to note that person-to-person
      spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
      while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading
      from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread
      the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients be isolated
      either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they
      are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
